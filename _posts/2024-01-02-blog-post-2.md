I've always found the informal explanations of quantum fields as little sets
of *"wiggling modes"* inadequate; the visualization of two electron packets
interacting with the "photon field" and the wiggling their way out in a Feynman Diagram
is, at most, misleading.

In basic quantum mechanics, we have these nice cuts of a complex function that give us
an actual set of wiggling probabilities to look at. They reflect, diffract and overall
gives us the exact picture of QFT many people handwave away; alas,

This is obvious just by inspecting a basic scalar field $$\phi(\mathbf{x})$$; rather than
a mapping $$\phi: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$$, it's a *operator-valued distribution*
of the form $$ \rho \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$$.

The wiggling fields
======

The most illuminating view of how we could "see" quantum fields is by means of a
very intuitive generalization procedure; if at first we looked at probability distributions
over spacetime, now we would look for probability distributions of *field configurations over
spacetime*.

Indeed, suppose we had a point charge distribution $$\rho\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})$$
at some spot in space, and around it we could assign some basic scalar field $$\phi(\mathbf{x})$$;
the associated quantized field would be, as a standard result, some function that maps you the
corresponding linear operator $$D$$ that could be mapped to

Therefore, we have

In the paper "working directly with probabilities in quantum field theory", we have that any
integral bounding $$\Sigma$$ ought to be proportional to the $$\exp(-iS/\hbar)P^2/\text{vol}$$

Why not use these functionals then?
======

It's only natural that we might want some easy calculational aid with the operators rather than
explictly computing in terms of functionals over bounded algebras
