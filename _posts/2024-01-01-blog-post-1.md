When analyzing fluid problems for engineering, we often take a look at the *streamlines*
associated to the flow solution $$u(\mathbf{x, t})$$ of the system; of course, we also 
assume it is steady, i.e $$\partial_t u = 0 $$. The classic *Zhukovksy map* is one of the
greatest triumps of computational physics pre-Neumann, I'd say:

But along there are terrible misunderstandings that sprout about; a lot of them
come from missaplications of the most useful principle in aerodynamics, **Bernoulli's
Principle of Equitable Flow**. With all modern generality afforded by the second law:

$$ \frac{H}{m} = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1} \frac{P_0}{P} \left ( \frac{P}{P_0} \right )^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} + mgh + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $$

The formula is straightforward enough to state; **along the streamline of a steady flow, the enthalpy is constant**. Let's tackle the history and general form of this formula, and how we can use it to make
a adequate bike.
