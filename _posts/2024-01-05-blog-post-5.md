God knows I enjoy a lot of cinematography, especially the more colorful stuff. It's no
wonder *Linus Sandgren* is one of my modern favorites. When I was first learning 3D animation in
Blender then, you can imagine my multiple (failed) attempts at producing stunning images like the ones
I saw in things like *Ran* and *Apocalypse Now*. These attempts then translated into me trying to make
these same visuals in actual filmmaking with a camera.

My complete lack of artistic expertise aside, I then learned of the differences in workflow between
coloring a real and virtual scene, and how **film emulation** within path tracers might be one of the most
useful algorithms one could make, and how I don't see any implementation of it today,
so really, this is more of a declaration of (yet another) open project, how to make
a *good* open-source camera?

In regards to what I'll say here: I'm ignorant, but I might as well be ignorant and loud, and then
hopefully someone will bonk me with a correction.

Boogie Nights
===

Be it Diggler's tragic but ultimately necessary break from his family or
the shoddines of the porno industry, *Boogie Nights* is nuanced in how
it portrays both the downfalls and get-ups from its characters, and that's
what makes it a great movie. Now, the *look* of the film are exceptional as well,
which made me interested to look into its technical sheet.

From basic sources like [SOW](https://shotonwhat.com/boogie-nights-1997)
and [ShotCafe](https://shot.cafe/movie/boogie-nights-1997/#boogie-nights-1997/boogie-nights-1997-51-8522),
as well as the [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/fullcredits), we already have a very
good idea on how this whole thing operates.

|  **Cameras** | Moviecam Compact Camera Panavision Panaflex Gold Camera |
|:------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|
|   **Lens**   |          Panavision C Series Anamorphic Lenses          |
| **Aperture** |                  Anamorphic/Panavision                  |
|   **Print**  |                           35mm                          |
|    **AR**    |                          2.39:1                         |
|   **Stock**  |          _Eastman EXR 100T 5248/7248 Neg. Film_         |

The DP was *Robert Elswit*, which to me was surprising since I don't like much of his work,
altough I can definitely see how he utilized the same sense as in *Inherent Vice* with the overblown
exposition in some scenes, alloy-like tones and general form of boxed framing, and the lead
colorist was *Mike Sowa*, which was to me a recognisable name because not long ago I looked into
the files of *The Creator* and he was a intermediate colorist.

Anyways, the major points for me are the obvious: the tasteful Eastman stock and the lens choice,
the rest gets down to color grading from the value curves taken from the shots.
Looking at the profiles of the film in [Kodak's old documents](https://125px.com/docs/motionpicture/kodak/5248.pdf), we get some key pieces of information:

![5248/7248_1](/files/images/Boogie_1.jpg)
![5248/7248_2](/files/images/Boogie_2.jpg)
![5248/7248_3](/files/images/Boogie_3.jpg)

Now to replicate this look digitally for 3D animation is often on the workflow
(AgX)$\rightarrow$(DaVinci Resolve), but I've
always wondered if it was possible to *directly* insert the characteristic curves
into the path tracer, a form of automatic color grading, but taking into account
effects like bleeding halos and such.

The difficulty in replicating any film stock in any path tracer is that, well, no
path tracer is perfectly physically sensible; sure, have your energy conservation and
PBR materials, the reality of the matter is that a 100W lightbulb in any test scene won't look
like a 100W lightbulb in real life, and unless you have a accurate simulation of a physically
motivated camera lens, with all of its optical oddities, you won't have any of the relevant
baseline features to even start comparing stock to a 3D scene.

Further, you can't simply translate any characteristic curve into code by sampling a spline
out of the fact no path tracer *works* under these principles in the rendering pipeline;
a great read on digital color is 
[here](https://www.fxguide.com/fxfeatured/the-art-of-digital-color/) and
this discussion on [replicating a 500T stock here](https://blenderartists.org/t/analog-film-look/1412819/5).

Attempts to make more realistic depictions of film renders in Blender have been done
[in this attempt to make a full simulated camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI8Olz-SPP4),
which is a nice exercise but of course beyond the bounds of ludicrously inefficient and expensive to
render. 

Looking at Cycles' [internal camera model](https://projects.blender.org/blender/cycles/src/branch/main/src/scene/camera.cpp), it is very complete, but it could still go a long ways in improving. Perhaps the first major change would be a faster thick lens model, and then a implementation of screenscast
lens flares. Ideally, the full thing should be capable of accepting model curves for film stocks
and then accurately displaying them under reference conditions, a interesting idea was a 
"camera nodes" setup.

I shall get to work on this eventually, for now, geometry processing.
