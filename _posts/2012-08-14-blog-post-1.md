Any elementary physics textbook will talk about Bernoulli's principle in fluid dynamics;
it's often stated as a trivial consequence of energy conservation, whereby dividing the kinectic,
potential and internal components gives you an equation of the form:

$$\frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho g z = \text{cst}$$

Of course, one can then talk about enthalpy conservation along a streamline segment $$ds$$:

Aren't headings cool?
