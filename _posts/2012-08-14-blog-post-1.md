When analyzing fluid problems for engineering, we often take a look at the *streamlines*
associated to the flow solution $$u(\mathbf{x})$$ of the system; of course, we also 
assume it is steady, i.e $$\partial_t u = 0 $$, otherwise we'd have to distinguish
between *stream/path/flowlines* of the solution:
