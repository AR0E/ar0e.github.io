No story is to me in mathematics more interesting than the emotionally charged end of the 19th century's
*vector wars*, the fight for which objects and conventions should be unilaterally used for expressing
vectors, their rotations and other geometrical operations.

The end to such a war is [well known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AaOFCl2ihc); *Gibbs'* treatise written conjuctly with Heaviside
ultimately skyrocketed to popularity because of its direct applications to electromagnetic
theory, and Hamilton's *quaternions* then sat idly by the side waiting for the mathematicians
to eventually pick them up again for [computer graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86MsWRvPjMw) and studies in [quantum theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5690).

Today's topic is of the extremely dismissed *geometric algebra* of the time, which has recently suffered
a renaissance by means of really enthusiastic members and great online content. More than 
lamenting how multivectors are not the universal expressions of physics and mathematics, I'd like to
review the historical basis for how they came to be, and why **Herman Grassman** was a one of a kind
individual. Specifically, a deeper dive into his masterwork, *A1*.

I'll start this examination by plainly stating this with no remorse.
*Grassman is the founding father of linear algebra*. Altough tabulated
matrices existed since [before Christ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Nine_chapters/)
with elementary and useful applications of traces, determinants, row-elimination and what such,
the actual ontological content and understanding of linear systems as sets of linear *vector spaces*
with simple addition and multiplication only came about in the 1800s, and was almost
*entirely* developed by Grassman.

Leibniz, as ever prophetic in whatever he did, attempted to develop some algebra of geometry in
clumsy differential approaches where magnitudes took precedence, and of course, complex numbers
were eventually given pictures by the likes of Gauss, but no one actually
managed to generate a algebraic calculus of geometric shapes. After being
inspired by his father's idea of a triangle being the "geometric product" of lines,
Grassman immediately went to work in forming a reasonable arithmetic of shapes.

The result is the spectacular *A1*, or the *Die Ausdehnungslehre*. It contains the first
mention of basis units $(\mathbf{e_1, \cdots e_n})$, the solutions to many theorems,
a primer of determinant theory in the form of outermorphisms 
$f(a\wedge b) = f\wedge a + f \wedge b$, and all kinds of transformations, such as dilations,
rotations, shearings and such using rotors.

A lot of documents briefly state A1's main results, namely, a description of solutions to 
Pfaffian system, Cramer's rules, and such, but I'd like to indulge in a bit more detail,
and showcase again *why* Grassman can be called a legitimate inventor of linear algebra.

What does A1 actually say?
=====

A1's work is highly philosophical; the majority of complaints, as Grassman himself
notes in A2, is that:


<blockquote cite="https://users.aalto.fi/~asihvola/umig.pdf">
  <p>
  The principal reason that moved me to this decision is the difficulty which,
according to all the mathematicians whose opinions I had the opportunity to hear,
the study of that work caused the reader on account of what they believed to
be its more philosophical than mathematical form. And this difficulty must in
fact have been considerable, since the geometric articles that I have written on
the interpretation of that work (...) are often cited and applied by other
mathematicians, but the domain treated in that work itself is nowhere touched
upon or applied, if I except an interesting short article by KYSAEUS.
As a consequence of this, no review of the book, or statement of its contents, 
has ever appeared, indeed not
a single mention of it outside of the publisher's list, except for one I wrote myself.

The beginning was Hegelian in spirit (altough he criticizes Hegel), by speaking in 
terms of categories and a unified body of work, a set of geometrical rules that should
apply to any dimension and transcend common experience. A ambitious and ultimately
sucessful effort; he for example, defines *extensive magnitudes*; these should be quantities,
similar to simple numbers as in that they act like magnitudes that can be summed, subtracted,
multiplied and divided, but rather than being strictly *point like* and *formless*, are extensive
in that they occupy a region of space.

The magnitudes should also all behave in the same way and by the same rules, and that
the initial goal is to simply *find the rules* for extensive quantities like lines, planes
and volumes. Grassman's program is that of the modern mathematician, he aims to generate
a appropriate algebra.

In the second page he begins his efforts; he defines a 
*synthetic connection* $$ (a \cup b) $$ that "links" two extensive quantities in general
form. He is very thorough in how he describes everything, 
even going as far as to explicitly state the meaning of the parenthesis:

<blockquote cite="https://users.aalto.fi/~asihvola/umig.pdf">
  <p>
"indem die Klammer hier ausdrucken soll dass die Verknupfung nicht 
mehr in der  Trennung ihrer. Glieder soll angeschaut werden, 
sondern als eine Einheit des Begriffs (...)"

"in that the parenthesis here is to express that the link is 
no longer in the separation of their. members, but rather as a u
nity of the term (...)"
  </p>
  <footer>—H. Grassman, <cite>A1, page 2</cite></footer>
</blockquote>


And spouting on the meaning of such a connection as relating extensive, formless
magnitudes as being the primitive geometrical entities, reflecting how the laws
should apply to *any* shape. In page 3 he then defines the idea of a associative law
$$ a\cup (b \cup c) = a \cup b \cup c $$, and later goes to define another
connection $$a \cap b$$, these then he argues to be addition and subtraction
in page 8 after lengthy reasoning.

This attitude is extremely remarkable, and not seen anywhere in his time; he was
explicitly defining additive and product rules by means of a general line of thought,
delineating how different "methods of expression" (algebras) should be formed.
This was criticized as verbose, but of course we all do it as standard practice now.

In the second section of the book he continues this program of slowly
building up operators that can work in extensive magnitudes. The name of the section,
*"Addition and subtraction of simple expansions of the first stage or the distances"*,
gives a clue as to what he does. He considers that now that we grasp completely
formless magnitudes, we may consider points. Physical space is then composed of such
points at a "dense" state.

Suppose we ought three extensive magnitudes of pointlike form, or without being verbose,
three points $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$.
One can form elementary connections/linkings of these elements in the same manner as in
the additive and subtractive case by considering the brackets $[\alpha \beta], [\beta \gamma], [\alpha \gamma]$; this new operator defines the *distance* between the points, so the first bracket
is the extensive magnitude formed by the distance between $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and so on; 
a 1-vector as we would think nowadays.


Consider the element $[\alpha \beta] + [\beta \gamma] = [\alpha \gamma]$, that is,
adding the two lengths to form a new one, between the first and last points in the brackets,
as per the classical geometrical interpretation of a triangle sum of two vectors. Subtract
the second bracket yielding $[\alpha \beta]  = [\alpha \gamma]-[\beta \gamma]$.
Now, consider the case $[\alpha \alpha]  = [\alpha \gamma]-[\alpha \gamma]$; this must
be null as per the rules he estabilished in the first section.

Now, this means that the line segment between two points is nill, which is perfectly
sensible, and this is equivalent to stating that the addition of a line segment with its
opposite is also nil, therefore the operator describes both the distance between the two points
and correctly describes vector addition. This gives us the rule:

$$ [AA] = 0 $$

*Grassman's simple introduction to the outer product*


One immediately notices this is the classic $A \wedge A = 0$ 
elementary definition of the exterior product. By using
the standard distributive rule Grassman immediately proves the identity $[AB] = -[BA]$.
I find this brilliant. He continues by giving a extensive list (pun intended) of
examples on how to utilize this product and how to interpret it.

For example, in the case $[AB] = -[BA]$ that was given, this simply means that the line
segment going from $A$ to $B$ is the opposite of the segment going from $B$ to $A$, and this
is then a manifestation of the direction of the outer product. Further, one can distribute
and repeatedly apply this product in chains as it is the same as repeatedly adding line
segments together in different directions.

The key insight on how the anticommutative product rule leads to a geometrical algebra
is the biggest highlight on the book in terms of conceptual analysis, the rest is
effectively how to use for useful theorem making.

One notable thing is Clifford's, as well as everyone's observation, that Grassman,
somehow, did not notice the existence of the geometric product as a sum of the
outer and inner products; that distinct observation eluded him, altough he studied
quaternions for a long time. 

A2
====

For the sake of results, let's concentrate on A2, which is the strickled down version
of A1 including a far clearer method of presentation.
The book is divided in two parts, **"The Elementary Conjuctions of Extensive Magnitudes"**,
**"The Theory of Functions"**. In plain terms, the first section with developing the
associated algebra and grammar, and the second dives into multivectorial functions.


The beginning is entirely different. It concentrates on proofs of basic relationships
using linear basis expansions of expressions, as one would in some introductory course:

His geometric calculus in *The Theory of Functions*
====

An extremely little known 
[(with sole exception to Ian Bell's page)](http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/maths/geoalgap.htm#A14)
idea of early geometric calculus was that of first implementing a *directed scalar derivative*
of extensive quantities rather than immediately implementing the now common *geometric derivative*:

*Directed scalar derivative*






Extensional Mechanics, or how to do geometric physics
======


On one of his seminal texts, called "[Mechanics, according to the principles
of the theory of extensions](http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/grassmann_-_mechanics_and_extensions.pdf)" of March of 1877, 
is interesting in how it historically fits with
other developments.

At page 6, section 2, he describes:

<q> The so-called *parallelogram law for force* can be expressed thus: If the effects of
several causes on the point $$x$$ equal the line segments $$p1, p2, \cdots,$$ when taken individually,
then the simultaneous effect $$p$$ of all of the causes is equal to the sum of the line segments
$$p = p1 + p2 + \cdots $$. Equation (1) is then also true when $$p$$ is the sum of all effects that the
various causes simultaneously exert on the moving point.<q>

First, I find the charming description *"parallelogram law"*. Clifford Truesdell in his book
*"Essays on the History of Mechanics* goes in great depth about this, 
but essentially, there were no vectorial
interpretations of force at the time, only vague geometrical statements about how to sum and
subtract forces acting on objects.

![](/files/images/Grassman_Truesdell1.jpg)
*iTruesdell's book, first page*

![](/files/images/Grassman_Truesdell2.jpg)
*Primitive parallelogram law of forces*

So as in the examples above, the notion of "directed magnitude" was somewhat rigidly set in the
heads of scientists, but with no capacity to either set cartesian systems for them or
to make them a more satisfying algebraic set of rules; indeed, the arguments for developing
proofs were all ultimately on Euclidean geometry, with no orientation whatsoever, that
ingredient being added at the end by means of intuitive thought and empirical evidence.

Here then, is one the first "vectorial" treatment of forces in physics, explicitly using
basis vectors $$\mathbf{e}_i$$ as the constructors of the force in a reference frame,
and carrying out algebra with them.

The rest of the article carries out with this logic, he gives a interesting derivation for
movement of oceanic flows and such, what he calls "eeb", it's a worth-it quick read.


Forder's book
========


A particularity that has been mentioned already is how Grassman's work originally
talked about using "points" to construct other fundamental quantities; multiplying and subtracting
points to form vectors and rotors, rather than directly starting out with vectors and then building
*k-vectors* out of them, as one would in Hestenes' approach nowadays

A book that is far more readable than A1 is then Ford's *"exterior calculus"*. I originally
became interested in the history of geometric algebra after finding it huddled in a small section
of my university's mathematical library. The last time it was taken out for reading was back in
1976! 


![](/files/images/Grassman_Forder1.jpg)
*The book's first page*

![](/files/images/Grassman_Forder2.jpg)
*It's first chapter in its table of contents*


The book is from 1940, and it is interesting. Another extremely similar treatment to it
is the plainly titled book [Treatise of Plane Geometry Through Geometric Algebra](http://tomlr.free.fr/Math%E9matiques/Math%20Complete/Geometry/Treatise%20of%20plane%20geometry%20through%20geometric%20algebra%20-%20Calvet%20R.G.%20-.pdf),
a surprisingly exhaustive and complete set of demonstrations of all major theorems in Euclidean Geometry
by means of 2D Euclidean and Projective geometric algebra. More surprising is that it was all done by a 
high-school teacher that provided it online for free. Here's an excerpt:

![Gonzale's book](/files/images//Grassman_Forder3.jpg)

Anyways, Forder's book has much to admire in its point construction of objects, and it's all
 in the first pages. Consider a point $\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{E}^n$, such a quantity is called
 an *extensive*, as in Grassman's book. The *difference extensive* $\mathbf{b-a}$ is, naturally,
 the vector $\bar{\mathbf{ab}}$ that points from $\mathbf{a}$ to $\mathbf{b}$, as per usual.

Later, Forder immediately talks about multivectors by discussing how to sum scalars, "weighted points"
and vectors, later the outer product with that old $[ab]$ notation system, and it has insights
such as how rotors $U$ may be understood as products of points, rather than vectors.

![Point rotors](/files/images//Grassman_Forder4.jpg)

At this point in time linear algebra was extremely well developed, so there was already a later
treatment in the book about matrix theory and its relations to extensive quantities; reading any modern
book on the topic makes clear he talks about *outermorphisms* and bivector representation theory,
altough not knowing it by those names. I have not read the full book, but it is very historically
interesting.


Grassman's death
========


I always found one of his last statements on the matter to be heartbreaking, and so I'll close
this post with it:

<blockquote cite="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/231908059.pdf">
  <p>I remain completely conident that the labour I have expended on the science presented here and which has demanded a significant part of my life as well as the most strenuous application of my powers, will not be lost. It is true that I am aware that the form which I have given the science is imperfect and must be imperfect. 

But I know and feel obliged to state (though I run the risk of seeming arrogant) **that even if this work should again remain unused for another seventeen years or even longer, without entering into the actual development of science, still that time will come when it will be brought forth from the dust of oblivion and when ideas now dormant will bring forth fruit.**

I know that if I also fail to gather around me (as I have until now desired in vain) a circle of scholars, whom I could fructify with these ideas, and whom I could stimulate to develop and enrich them further, yet there will come a time when these ideas, perhaps in a new form, will arise anew and will enter into a living communication with contemporary developments. 

**For truth is eternal and divine and no phase of it ... can pass without a trace; it remains in existence even if the cloth in which weak mortals dress it disintegrates into dust.**</p>
