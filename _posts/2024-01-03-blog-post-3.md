No story is to me in mathematics more interesting than the emotionally charged end of the 19th century's
*vector wars*, the fight for which objects and conventions should be unilaterally used for expressing
vectors, their rotations and other geometrical operations.

The end to such a war is [well known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AaOFCl2ihc); *Gibbs'* treatise written conjuctly with Heaviside
ultimately skyrocketed to popularity because of its direct applications to electromagnetic
theory, and Hamilton's *quaternions* then sat idly by the side waiting for the mathematicians
to eventually pick them up again for [computer graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86MsWRvPjMw) and studies in [quantum theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5690).

Today's topic is of the extremely dismissed *geometric algebra* of the time, which has recently suffered
a renaissance by means of really enthusiastic members and great online content. More than 
lamenting how multivectors are not the universal expressions of physics and mathematics, I'd like to
review the historical basis for how they came to be, and why **Herman Grassman** was a one of a kind
individual.

Grassman is the founding father of linear algebra
====
====

I'll start this examination by plainly stating this with no remorse. Altough tabulated
matrices existed since [before Christ](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/HistTopics/Nine_chapters/)
with elementary and useful applications of traces, determinants, row-elimination and what such,
the actual ontological content and understanding of linear systems as sets of linear *vector spaces*
with simple addition and multiplication only came about in the 1800s, and was almost
*entirely* developed by Grassman.

Leibniz, as ever prophetic in whatever he did, attempted to develop some algebra of geometry in
clumsy differential approaches where magnitudes took precedence, and of course, complex numbers
were eventually given pictures by the likes of Gauss, but 

What does A1 actually say?
=====
=====

A lot of documents briefly state A1's main results, namely, a description of solutions to 
Pfaffian system, Cramer's rules, and such, but I'd like to indulge in a bit more detail,
and showcase again *why* Grassman can be called a legitimate inventor of linear algebra.

The book starts with


Extensional Mechanics, or how to do geometric physics
======
======

On one of his seminal texts, called "[Mechanics, according to the principles
of the theory of extensions](http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/grassmann_-_mechanics_and_extensions.pdf)" of March of 1877, 
is interesting in how it historically fits with
other developments.

At page 6, section 2, he describes:

<q> The so-called *parallelogram law for force* can be expressed thus: If the effects of
several causes on the point $$x$$ equal the line segments $$p1, p2, \cdots,$$ when taken individually,
then the simultaneous effect $$p$$ of all of the causes is equal to the sum of the line segments
$$p = p1 + p2 + \cdots $$. Equation (1) is then also true when $$p$$ is the sum of all effects that the
various causes simultaneously exert on the moving point.<q>

First, I find the charming description *"parallelogram law"*. Clifford Truesdell in his book
*"Essays on the History of Mechanics* goes in great depth about this, 
but essentially, there were no vectorial
interpretations of force at the time, only vague geometrical statements about how to sum and
subtract forces acting on objects.

*iTruesdell's book, first page*

So as in the examples above, the notion of "directed magnitude" was somewhat rigidly set in the
heads of scientists, but with no capacity to either set cartesian systems for them or
to make them a more satisfying algebraic set of rules; indeed, the arguments for developing
proofs were all ultimately on Euclidean geometry, with no orientation whatsoever, that
ingredient being added at the end by means of intuitive thought and empirical evidence.

Here then, is one the first "vectorial" treatment of forces in physics, explicitly using
basis vectors $$\mathbf{e}_i$$ as the constructors of the force in a reference frame,
and carrying out algebra with them.

The rest of the article carries out with this logic, he gives a interesting derivation for
movement of oceanic flows and such, what he calls "eeb", it's a worth-it quick read.


Forder's book
========
========

A particularity that has been mentioned already is how Grassman's work originally
talked about using "points" to construct other fundamental quantities; multiplying and subtracting
points to form vectors and rotors, rather than directly starting out with vectors and then building
*k-vectors* out of them, as one would in Hestenes' approach nowadays

A book that is far more readable than A1 is then Ford's *"exterior calculus"*. I originally
became interested in the history of geometric algebra after finding it huddled in a small section
of my university's mathematical library. The last time it was taken out for reading was back in
1976!

*The book's first page*

![](/files/images/Grassman_Forder2.jpg)
*It's first chapter in its table of contents*


The book is from 1940, and it is interesting. Another extremely similar treatment to it
is the plainly titled book [Treatise of Plane Geometry Through Geometric Algebra](http://tomlr.free.fr/Math%E9matiques/Math%20Complete/Geometry/Treatise%20of%20plane%20geometry%20through%20geometric%20algebra%20-%20Calvet%20R.G.%20-.pdf),
a surprisingly exhaustive and complete set of demonstrations of all major theorems in Euclidean Geometry
by means of 2D Euclidean and Projective geometric algebra. More surprising is that it was all done by a 
high-school teacher that provided it online for free. Here's an excerpt:

![Gonzale's book](/files/images//Grassman_Forder3.jpg)

Anyways, Forder's book has much to admire in its point construction of objects, and it's all
 in the first pages. Consider a point $\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{E}^n$, such a quantity is called
 an *extensive*, as in Grassman's book. The *difference extensive* $\mathbf{b-a}$ is, naturally,
 the vector $\bar{\mathbf{ab}}$ that points from $\mathbf{a}$ to $\mathbf{b}$, as per usual.

Later, Forder immediately talks about multivectors by discussing how to sum scalars, "weighted points"
and vectors, later the outer product with that old $[ab]$ notation system, and it has insights
such as how rotors $U$ may be understood as products of points, rather than vectors.

![Point rotors](/files/images//Grassman_Forder4.jpg)

At this point in time linear algebra was extremely well developed, so there was already a later
treatment in the book about matrix theory and its relations to extensive quantities; reading any modern
book on the topic makes clear he talks about *outermorphisms* and bivector representation theory,
altough not knowing it by those names. I have not read the full book, but it is very historically
interesting.


Grassman's death
========
========

I always found one of his last statements on the matter to be heartbreaking, and so I'll close
this post with it:

<blockquote cite="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/231908059.pdf">
  <p>I remain completely conident that the labour I have expended on the science presented here and which has demanded a significant part of my life as well as the most strenuous application of my powers, will not be lost. It is true that I am aware that the form which I have given the science is imperfect and must be imperfect. 

But I know and feel obliged to state (though I run the risk of seeming arrogant) **that even if this work should again remain unused for another seventeen years or even longer, without entering into the actual development of science, still that time will come when it will be brought forth from the dust of oblivion and when ideas now dormant will bring forth fruit.**

I know that if I also fail to gather around me (as I have until now desired in vain) a circle of scholars, whom I could fructify with these ideas, and whom I could stimulate to develop and enrich them further, yet there will come a time when these ideas, perhaps in a new form, will arise anew and will enter into a living communication with contemporary developments. 

**For truth is eternal and divine and no phase of it ... can pass without a trace; it remains in existence even if the cloth in which weak mortals dress it disintegrates into dust.**</p>
