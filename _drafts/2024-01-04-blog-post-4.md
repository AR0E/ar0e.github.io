God knows I enjoy a lot of cinematography, especially the more colorful stuff. It's no
wonder *Linus Sandgren* is one of my modern favorites. When I was first learning 3D animation in
Blender then, you can imagine my multiple (failed) attempts at producing stunning images like the ones
I saw in things like *Ran* and *Apocalypse Now*. These attempts then translated into me trying to make
these same visuals in actual filmmaking with a camera.

My complete lack of artistic expertise aside, I then learned of the differences in workflow between
coloring a real and virtual scene, and how **film emulation** within path tracers might be one of the most
useful algorithms one could make.
