Hello!
=======

My name's Artur, I'm a Brazilian electronic engineer and automation technician, but over the years
I've had a pretty wide range of interests, such as motorcycle engineering
for racing competitions, graphics programming with an emphasis
in discrete differential geometry, and more advanced subjects in physics,
mathematics and the other natural sciences.

I have a [CV](https://ar0e.github.io/files/CV1.pdf), that's where you can see those things in more detail,
I have a [portfolio](https://ar0e.github.io/portfolio/) where I share some of my major projects, and 
I got a [blog](https://ar0e.github.io/year-archive/) for endless rambling. That's all.

Here's a resource list:

* My [definitive reading list](https://ar0e.github.io/reading-list/)

A non-exhaustive "exercise solutions" list I've started to make. I feel as if too
much work has no actual worked out solutions for beginning students, so I'm making
an effort to correct that.
