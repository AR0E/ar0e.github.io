Hello!
=======

My name's Artur, I'm a Brazilian electronic engineer and automation technician, but over the years
I've had a pretty wide range of interests, such as motorcycle engineering
for racing competitions, graphics programming with an emphasis
in discrete differential geometry, and more advanced subjects in physics,
mathematics and the other natural sciences.

I have a [CV](https://ar0e.github.io/files/CV1.pdf), that's where you can see those things in more detail,
I have a [portfolio](https://ar0e.github.io/portfolio/) where I share some of my major projects, and 
I got a [blog](https://ar0e.github.io/year-archive/) for endless rambling. That's all.

In possible doubts: yes, I've had two other sites before this one, but I thought it was the decent thing
to completely overhaul myself from old Wordpress to github pages at once and start over, rather
than transferring over and such and such.
