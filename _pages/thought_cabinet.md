# Thought cabinet

Here's a small collection of thoughts I see from people on the internet.
It is of course, not even remotely representative of all the ones I've seen,
only the ones I can remember enough to put here.

<summary>Ashes of an exhibition</summary>

> In college, there was an art exhibition on campus focused on the
impermanence of art. One of the exhibits was a bowl of ashes titled
"this painting was destroyed before the exhibition. Next to it was an
oil paintingh titled "this painting will be destroyed if it is
not taken by the end of the exhibition. I visited the exhibition 
every day, and no one took the painting. On the last day, the painting
was still there. I couldn t bear to see such craftsmanship destroyed,
so I took it. Now it hangs on my bedroom, where only I can see it.
Lately, I find myself looking at it and thinking "I'm the only who
ever sees this painting. Is it any different than if it were
destroyed?" -thunderheadcinema6743

<summary>Some Disco Elysium quotes</summary>

> The sun sets into the sea, but the water does not boil.
Instead, it turns into liquid gold. For a moment, the world's
store of precious metals seem to increase dramatically,
you are rich...

> Instead of air, you exhale thoughts. There are no trees
that eat thoughts.

> (On how the world is sufficient) This is the greatest and kindest arrangement 
the atoms had in them.

> Before you is a temple of pain that knew little tenderness
in life.

> This is real darkness. It's not death, or war, or child
molestation. Real darkness has love for a face. The first death
is in the heart, Harry.

<summary>Poetic endings</summary>

<summary>Heaven</summary>

> There is also a heaven upon earth in our own breasts.
Do not seek it without, but within your heart ; then you 
will not come into heaven for the first time when you die, 
but remain in it always. - A Twofold Life, Wilhelmine von Hillern
