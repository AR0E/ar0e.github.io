My first big electronics project, and my final paper of my Industrial Automation degree. It was a
hell of a lot of work for someone that didn't quite know what a transistor was at the beginning of the year!

The whole thing is analog; the key matrix, controller, oscillators, filters, VCAs, you name it. The whole
project is described in detail in my actual paper, which [I'm linking here as a PDF](files/TCCETEC2022.pdf) along with some images:

I have yet to actually record it working since the pre-amp broke shortly before I switched cities,
so that's terribly annoying!
